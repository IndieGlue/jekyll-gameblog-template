![Us 3 developing]({{ "../../../../../assets/posts/dev.jpg" }})

This is us developing on an extremely hot day in Cape Town, South Africa. The reason being is we've set ourselves a tight deadline for our alpha launch in order to get as much user feedback before we continue building levels.

Another reason for this drive is we've decided to compile a roadmap to have visibility on what needs to be done by the end of Feb 2018. Funny enough it is the shortest month of the year, which doesn't really help much.

How do you keep yourself motivated? Let us know in the comments below.
